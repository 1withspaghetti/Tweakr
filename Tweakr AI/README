2. Open PyCharm and create a new project.

## Import All Files

1. Place all your project files (`run.py`, `tweakAI.py`, `main.py`, tut5-model.pt, requirements.txt) into the project directory.

## Set Up the Virtual Environment

1. Within your project's virtual environment, download and run `get-pip.py` to ensure you have pip installed. You can find `get-pip.py` [here](https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py).

    ```bash
    python tweakAI.py
    ```
